# photo-sifter

Sift through photos using arrow keys

## About The Project

As someone who enjoys capturing memories on a digital camera, I end up with hundreds to thousands of photos to process at one given time.
Procrastination gets the best of me when thinking about the task I've given myself, but I also want to get them in the hands of family and friends as soon as possible.

Instead of spending my spare time sifting through my most recent collection of photos, I used it to build this tool. Let's hope it pays off in the future ðŸ˜…
