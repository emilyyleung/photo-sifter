# photo-sifter

Sift through good and bad photos using arrow keys

## About The Project

As someone who enjoys capturing memories on my digital camera, I end up with hundreds to thousands of photos that need sorting at a time.
With that many to sort through, I find the process of selecting the best ones to share with family and friends to be a tedious one.

As a result, instead of spending my spare time going through and organise my most recent collection of photos, I used it to build this tool - hoping that it will pay off in the future ðŸ˜…

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

2. Clone the repo
3. Install the dependencies
4. Copy images into 'photos' folder
